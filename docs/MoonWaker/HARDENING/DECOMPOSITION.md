# Bounded mandatory decomposition — normative

## Goal
Reduce responsibilities owned by affected monoliths during the behavioral fixes. This requirement authorizes cohesive extraction; it does not authorize a repository-wide rewrite or cosmetic churn. Existing owners take precedence over new classes. Class names in handoffs are provisional until actual code is inspected.

## Responsibility map
S00 records path/symbol, mutable state, effects, callers, lifetime, desired existing/new owner, package/deployment dependencies and regression seam. Prioritize Game.java, ConsoleActivity.java, wakeplay_gateway.py and GameProviderBridge.py in the changed paths. Record original metrics for review context; do not impose an arbitrary maximum file length.

| Slice | Required ownership result |
|---|---|
| S01 | One immutable actor/execution Gateway context and unambiguous construction at all affected callers. |
| S02 | Retention defaults/migration live in the existing policy owner, not divergent Activity branches. |
| S03 | Windows preparation/cancellation/typed results owned outside ConsoleActivity. |
| S04 | One concrete transport-stop/completion owner, integrated into Game and retained callers. |
| S05 | MoonWaker termination/child-terminal orchestration outside Game; host effect-time fencing separated from HTTP routing. Existing authoritative budgets/journal stay authoritative. |
| S06 | Coherent producer plus one observation/projection path; remove competing UI/start decisions from Activities. |
| S07 | Physical transport runtime/state outside Activity behind the retained facade; view attachment is separate from resource lifetime. |
| S08 | Shared warm-up/Play sequencing outside ConsoleActivity in existing orchestrator/preflight owners. |
| S09 | Small generation-fenced presentation barrier, not a second privacy state machine. |

## Extraction sequence inside a task
Characterize behavior → choose the existing owner/narrow seam → move cohesive state and effects → switch ALL relevant callers → remove old implementation/fields → build packaged artifacts → run behavior, integration and risk-based device checks. Internal passes may temporarily be incomplete only inside the unaccepted candidate. There is no accepted 'add empty manager now, wire later' slice.

## Reject
- A helper receiving Game or ConsoleActivity to reach their mutable fields.
- Copying flags into a helper while Activity remains the competing owner.
- A new SessionManager with all the old responsibilities under a different filename.
- Static singletons retaining Activity/views/listeners beyond their lifetime.
- Merely moving methods, counting lines, adding interfaces with no concrete need, or masking dependency cycles through generic callbacks.
- Reimplementing LaunchTransitionController, SessionOrchestrator, OperationJournal or durable child accounting.
- Moving Python modules without updating packaging/install/import paths and related isolated tests.

## Acceptance and scope
Every task supplies architecture.json from the template: old/new owner, moved state/effects, caller migration, deleted paths, lifetime and packaging proof. An already-well-factored small component may receive an independently reviewed NO_EXTRACTION_NEEDED entry with code evidence; large affected MoonWaker responsibilities listed above may not be deferred wholesale. No requirement to split untouched upstream Moonlight decoder/input code solely because the containing file is long.
Structural checks can enforce forbidden imports/references and removed owner fields; they complement, not replace, behavioral tests. Improve names/duplication/error contracts in the responsibility being moved. Keep unrelated formatting, upgrades and general cleanup out of the diff.
